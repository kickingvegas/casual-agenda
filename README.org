* NOTICE

This package has been superseded by the package [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual][casual]]. Please install the package ~casual~ from either [[https://melpa.org/#/casual][MELPA]] or [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/casual][MELPA stable]].

Upon installation and upgrade of ~casual~, this package will be uninstalled from your Emacs configuration. Please revisit your configuration of Casual Agenda in your initialization file(s) accordingly.

This repository should be treated as an archive. All future development on Casual Agenda will be done in the [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual][Casual repository]].

* Casual Agenda
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based user interface for [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Agenda-Views.html][Org Agenda]], a feature of Emacs [[https://orgmode.org/features.html][Org mode]] to help plan your day.

[[file:docs/images/casual-agenda-screenshot.png]]

* Motivation
While highly functional, Org Agenda has a steep learning curve as it has a very diverse command set. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offer users discoverability and recognition that can lower Org Agenda's learning curve. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual Agenda endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI for Org Agenda.
- To provide casual access to the Org Agenda command set.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all Org Agenda commands. Casual Agenda is not intended to be a power user tool.
- Strict adherence to Org Agenda command naming. While Casual Agenda is *mostly* in alignment with Org Agenda’s command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual Agenda is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements
Casual Agenda requires usage of
- Emacs ≥ 29.1 
- Org ≥ 9.7.1

Casual Agenda has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.4 (macOS 14.6, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)
- Org 9.7.9

* Asks
As Casual Agenda is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-agenda/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual Agenda's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via [[https://melpa.org/#/casual-agenda][MELPA]] then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-agenda) ; optional
  (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-agenda-tmenu)
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-agenda
    :ensure nil
    :bind (:map
           org-agenda-mode-map
           ("C-o" . casual-agenda-tmenu))
    :after (org-agenda))
#+end_src


** A Note on Package Dependencies
Casual Agenda requires a recent installation of both Org ([[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/org.html][9.7.1+ from GNU ELPA]]) and Transient (0.6.0+ from either [[https://melpa.org/#/transient][MELPA]] or [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/transient.html][ELPA]]). As both these packages are built-in, the package manager ~package.el~ will /not/ update either of these packages unless the customizable variable ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ is set to ~t~. If your setup does not have the latest Transient update, you will see the following error when trying to run ~casual-agenda-tmenu~:

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  Loading casual-agenda.el
    casual-agenda.el:Error: Emacs 29.4:
    (invalid-slot-name "#<transient-prefix transient-prefix-157ade83abb6>" :refresh-suffixes)
#+end_src

Again, set the variable ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ to ~t~ to upgrade both Org and Transient. Alternately, invoke ~package-install~ with a prefix argument which will override the default setting of ~package-install-upgrade-built-in~ and upgrade a built-in package. (example: ~C-u M-x package-install~ ~casual-agenda~)

As Transient is closely tied to Magit, installing the latest version of Magit (via [[https://elpa.nongnu.org/nongnu/magit.html][non-GNU ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/magit][MELPA]]) can also pick up the latest version of Transient.

** Configuration
Use these bindings to configure Org Agenda to be consistent with bindings used by Casual Agenda. This is optional.

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  ; bindings to make jumping consistent between Org Agenda and Casual Agenda
  (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "M-j" #'org-agenda-clock-goto) ; optional
  (keymap-set org-agenda-mode-map "J" #'bookmark-jump) ; optional
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, modify your configuration as follows:
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-agenda
    :ensure nil
    :bind (:map
           org-agenda-mode-map
           ("C-o" . casual-agenda-tmenu)
           ("M-j" . org-agenda-clock-goto) ; optional
           ("J" . bookmark-jump))) ; optional
#+end_src



* Usage

The main menu is divided into five sections:

- *Agenda* - Modify the view duration (day, week, year)
- *Filter* - Filter displayed headlines with different criteria
- *Actions* - Perform an activity on a headline, create/capture a headline or even generate a different agenda view.
- *Navigation* - move the point to where you want it to be.
- *Utils* - Set a timer, get almanac info.

** Unicode Symbol Support

* Common Menu Actions
Casual Agenda is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. 

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~C-q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, which will return you to the previous menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

Menu items can also take a prefix argument if supported. Enter ~C-u~ and optionally a value before selecting a menu item.
